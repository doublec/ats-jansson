Overview
========

The source for the ATS wrapper for the jansson JSON library [1] is maintained
on github [2].

If you have 'git' installed you can retrieve the source and build by
running 'make'. To remove the git source run 'make cleangit'.

You can overide the git repostory used when running make (to use a
fork for example) by specifying the REMOTE variable:

  make REMOTE=~/jansson.git
